      <p>The longest running &quot;Outdoor Haunted Attraction&quot; in Illinois. 36 years of scaring Central Illinois, the Marquette Heights Men's Club presents three truly horrifying events for one admission price. Spook Hollow, the one that started it all will lead you deep into the woods of Independence Park. M.C. Manor, a spine tingling haunted mansion with movie quality rooms, provide the scare factor you crave. If that isn't enough, M.C. Nightmare will lead you through a twisted and run down industrial haunt destine to claim as another lost soul deep within it's rusty walls. The three haunts combine to bring you a &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot; for one admission price. </p>
